# 0x16. API Advanced

## Description
This project involves interacting with the Reddit API using Python scripts to perform various tasks such as querying endpoints, handling pagination, making recursive API calls, parsing JSON responses, and sorting dictionaries.

Mastering API calls is essential for technical interviews and real-world applications. This project ensures familiarity with API documentation and practical API interactions.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will be able to:
- Read API documentation to identify required endpoints.
- Use APIs with pagination.
- Parse JSON responses from an API.
- Make recursive API calls.
- Sort dictionaries by value.

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All scripts must be executable and written in Python 3.4.3.
- All scripts should follow PEP 8 styling.
- All scripts must start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- Libraries must be imported in alphabetical order.
- The length of scripts will be tested using `wc`.
- Must use the `requests` module for HTTP requests.
- Modules must have proper documentation.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project is mandatory.

## Resources
- [Reddit API Documentation](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/)
- [Query String Documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string)

## Tasks Overview
1. Query Reddit API endpoints.
2. Handle pagination when fetching data.
3. Parse and process JSON responses.
4. Implement recursive API calls.
5. Sort API response data.

This project enforces strict coding standards and prohibits plagiarism.
